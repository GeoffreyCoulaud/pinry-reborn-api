/**
 * Deletes a user data export on request (spec `docs/specs/2026-07-22-user-data-export.md` §6):
 * owner-checked through [UserDataExportGetter], then one fenced write of `DELETED` over any state
 * that is not already `isGone`, the release taken from the state that write replaced. A row already
 * gone keeps the state that says why, and the bytes it still names are released again, that replay
 * being the fast repair for a first attempt whose release failed after its write landed; the export
 * sweep's third pass is the guaranteed one.
 *
 * Only the `READY` arm propagates a storage failure, because that delete is the user's own
 * operation. The other two are residue cleanup and best-effort (`docs/adr/0003`, decision 1): the
 * `PENDING` arm releases the key a build derives, which is where a promote whose transaction rolled
 * back left its bytes (`docs/adr/0017`, decision 2).
 *
 * [CancelTask.cancel]'s `Boolean` result is deliberately ignored: whether the task was still
 * cancellable or had already settled, the export is being deleted either way, so branching on it
 * would create a side with no observable difference and no way to test it.
