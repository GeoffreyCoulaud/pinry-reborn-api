 * Content types written into a user data export archive
 * (spec `docs/specs/2026-07-22-user-data-export.md` §4). Field names are the published archive
 * format: renaming a property here renames a file's on-disk shape, so they are copied from the spec
 * verbatim, not "improved". Nullability mirrors the corresponding domain entity's; per spec §4,
 * "absent values are `null`, never omitted" (see [ExportContentGoldenJsonTest] for the pinned proof).
 *
 * Deliberately plain Kotlin, with no Jackson import: `api-usecases` carries no Jackson dependency on
 * its main classpath (Jackson is adapter-only, per the plan's tech stack). The adapter
 * (`FilesystemZipExportArchiveStore`, in `api-storage-filesystem`) supplies its own, explicitly
 * configured `ObjectMapper` and serializes these types through plain JavaBean getter introspection
 * (there is no `jackson-module-kotlin` anywhere in this codebase).
