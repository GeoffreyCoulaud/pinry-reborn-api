/**
 * Reclaim soft-deleted account tombstones whose delete task is no longer in flight: re-drives
 * [AccountDeletionCleaner.deleteAccountData] on each, which finishes any partial delete and
 * hard-deletes the tombstone. The grace avoids re-driving an account whose delete task is still
 * running.
 *
 * Not `@ApplicationScoped`: [tombstoneGrace] is a primitive ARC cannot resolve, so the bean is
 * produced in wiring (`GarbageCollectionProducers`), mirroring `ExportProducers` for
 * `ReapUserDataExports`.
 *
 * The second logger in `api-usecases`: the cleaner's DB transaction can still throw (its disk half
 * is best-effort after Sequence 1), so each re-drive is isolated in its own try/catch and a failure
 * is logged at WARN rather than aborting the batch. One bad tombstone must not block the rest
 * (docs/adr/0003-periodic-gc-and-best-effort-cleanup.md, consequence of the periodic garbage
 * collection design).
