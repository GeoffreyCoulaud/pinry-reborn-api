/**
 * Per-attempt context handed to a [TaskHandler]: the current attempt number, the task's budget, and
 * a lease heartbeat.
 *
 * [renewLease] lets a long-running handler push its lease expiry back so the reaper does not reclaim
 * the task, and a second worker does not start running it concurrently, while it is still working.
 * It throws `TaskLeaseLostException` when the queue refuses the renewal: the lease is another
 * attempt's or nobody's, nothing this handler writes can be published, and the handler stops there
 * (`docs/adr/0022`). It defaults to a no-op, so handlers that finish well within one lease never have
 * to think about it. It is deliberately not part of the value identity (only [attempt] and
 * [maxAttempts] are), so two contexts for the same attempt compare equal regardless of which
 * heartbeat they carry.
