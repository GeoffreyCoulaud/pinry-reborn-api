/**
 * The wall clock is read in one place, the implementation of the `Clock` port.
 *
 * A hidden clock makes its caller untestable, and it bypasses the truncation that keeps a stamped
 * instant equal to itself across a save and a read. The exemption is structural rather than a list
 * of blessed files: a class that declares the port may read the clock, and that is what makes it
 * the port.
 *
 * Reading the syntax tree rather than the file text is what separates a call from a sentence about
 * one: the port's own KDoc contains `Instant.now()` and is not a violation.
 *
 * ## Reach
 *
 * Four reads are reported by default, each written on its receiver: `Instant.now()`,
 * `LocalDate.now()`, `LocalDateTime.now()` and `System.currentTimeMillis()`. That shape is the only
 * one seen, since the rule visits dot-qualified expressions and nothing else. Three boundaries
 * follow, all deliberate.
 *
 * A bare `now()`, reached through a static import, is not a dot-qualified expression and is never
 * visited. Telling it from a local method of the same name takes the declaration it resolves to,
 * and this rule set runs without type resolution, so covering that form would mean reporting every
 * `now()` written anywhere.
 *
 * The four names are the whole default list, and it is closed rather than exhaustive: it covers the
 * ways this project writes the read. `ZonedDateTime`, `OffsetDateTime`, `LocalTime`,
 * `System.nanoTime()`, `java.util.Date()` and `Calendar.getInstance()` reach the same clock by other
 * routes and go unreported until `wallClockReads` names them.
 *
 * The scope is production and test sources in every module but the one declaring this rule, which
 * cannot carry itself as a detekt plugin. Test sources take the fixed TestTime instant rather than
 * reading the clock; only the testFixtures source set is excluded, because it hosts that seam.
