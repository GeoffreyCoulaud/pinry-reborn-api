/**
 * A row is written inside the transaction that read it.
 *
 * `Persistor.merge` writes every column and only `TaskModel` carries a version, so saving a row read
 * earlier restores that row's whole state, including whatever another actor committed in between. The
 * import lot found nine sites of that one defect before making the read and the write a single fenced
 * pair; the P2 lot found three more on pins and boards (`docs/specs/2026-09-05-p2-debt-elimination.md`,
 * 4.6) and put one generic fence under every feature (`usecases/Fences.kt`).
 *
 * ## Reach
 *
 * The test is **inverted**, and this is the rule's whole shape: a `save*` handed one argument is
 * reported unless that argument is a construction. An insert is legal because a fresh row has no
 * earlier state to restore; everything else names a row that was read somewhere the transaction does
 * not cover. Chasing the shapes that do merge is what the first version tried, keying on a `copy` call
 * written where the save is, and a named local, a scoping function around the copy or one around the
 * save all walked past it. A save taking two arguments (`saveSessionToken(token, hash)`) names no row
 * that was read, and is not the shape.
 *
 * A construction is told from a call by its name starting upper case, Kotlin's own convention, since
 * this rule set runs without type resolution. So does the rest: `save*`, `inTransaction`, `fenced` and
 * `fencedOver` are spellings, not resolved members, and a function named `fenced` elsewhere is taken
 * for the helper. The scope is set in `detekt.yml`, by path, over every use case.
 *
 * ## Three limits, each accepted
 *
 * **A construction is an insert to the rule, whatever it rebuilds.** A row rebuilt field by field from
 * an earlier read, `Pin(id = old.id, ...)`, is a construction here and a merge to the database. No
 * lexical criterion separates the two; type resolution would, at a cost on every gate for a shape
 * nobody writes here (spec D8, `docs/backlog.md` Known limits).
 *
 * **A `save*` passed as a callable reference is outside its sight**, `::save` being no call the rule
 * visits. The four `saveFenced` delegations spell their write as a lambda, `{ save(it) }`, for that
 * reason, and so must the next one.
 *
 * **The rule sees where the write is, not where the read was.** A row read outside and saved inside a
 * transaction passes it: opening a transaction around a row taken before it changes nothing about
 * what the merge restores. That half is a behaviour, held by behaviour tests whose transaction fake
 * answers a read taken outside one with a cancelled row (`UserDataImportRunnerTest`,
 * `UserDataImportCancellerTest`), and by the pin and board sites' cases, whose fence re-reads a
 * recycled row. This rule is the other half: it fails the build on a writer that never opened a
 * transaction at all, which is the shape every one of the twelve sites took.
 *
 * A row built somewhere else and handed over through a property is reported all the same
 * (`imageRepository.save(created.image)` in `UserDataImportRunner`, suppressed inline with its reason):
 * the rule cannot see where that value came from, and the answer that keeps its reach is to report and
 * let the site say why. That suppression is the rule's only one, and the function that saves is the
 * function that opens the transaction everywhere else, which is what keeps the fence lexical.
