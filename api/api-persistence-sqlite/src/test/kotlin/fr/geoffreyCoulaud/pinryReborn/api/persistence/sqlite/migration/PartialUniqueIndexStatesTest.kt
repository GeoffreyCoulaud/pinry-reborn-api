/**
 * A partial unique index constrains the rows its `where` clause selects, and the query that means those rows
 * repeats the same states in Kotlin. Each set is named once in [PartialUniqueIndexStates]; this pins it to the
 * predicate the current schema gives the index, so a narrowing or a widening of either side fails here rather
 * than leaving the two disagreeing (spec `docs/specs/2026-08-12-p2-debt-triage.md:142-155`).
 *
 * The history is append-only, so an index is whatever the last migration that touched it left: this guard reads
 * `MigrationDirectory.currentIndexes`, which replays every creation and removal in version order and keeps a
 * drop-and-recreate pair from reading as two live indexes with two predicates to satisfy at once.
 *
 * Unique indexes only: a partial index that is not unique is a plan hint, so a query naming other states than
 * its predicate is slower, while the same disagreement on a unique one is a wrong answer.
 *
 * What it does not check, deliberately:
 * - It reads the literals the `state` comparison names, not what the predicate means, so
 *   `not (state in ('PENDING','RUNNING'))` passes on the set whose complement it selects.
 * - Its reach is a predicate quoting a literal, so a partial index on `where soft_deleted_at is null` is
 *   extracted and then dropped by that filter, and demands no Kotlin set.
 * - Nothing stops a query from re-inlining the literals, since the comparison is between the named set and the
 *   DDL and never between the named set and what the query reads.
 * - That `findOne()` returns at most one row rests on the index's uniqueness columns, which it does not read.
