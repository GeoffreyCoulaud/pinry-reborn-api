# Pinry Reborn

Pinry Reborn is a self-hosted media pin board.  
Its goal is to reimplement [Pinry](https://github.com/pinry/pinry) and extend its functionalities.

## Why?

1. Because the Pinry project is not maintained anymore.  
2. Because I wanted to add features to Pinry
3. Because I wanted to try to build a real life project using Kotlin, Quarkus and Gradle.
