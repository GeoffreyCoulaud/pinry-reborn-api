# Pinry Reborn - API server

This directory contains the API server for the project.  
It is in charge of all the business logic, to be called by clients.

## Running

To start the API locally in dev mode

```sh
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

## Architecture

The API follows the clean architecture principle, with each part in its own submodule.
