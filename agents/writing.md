# Writing and documentation

## Two regimes

| Regime     | Property                                                         | Rule                                                   |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dated**  | Append-only once frozen: records what was believed on that date. | Never edit a frozen document; write a superseding one. |
| **Living** | Describes the present; drifts silently.                          | Updated in the same commit as the change.              |

| Document                                       | Regime                                                                             |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `docs/backlog.md`  | living                                                                             |
| `AGENTS.md` (root and `api/`), `agents/*.md`, `agents/reviews/*` | living: updated in the same commit as the change they describe   |
| `contract/openapi.json`                        | generated: written by the API's build, refused by the gate when stale, never edited by hand |
| `docs/specs`, `docs/adr`, `docs/handoffs`      | dated, append-only                                                                 |

## Rules

- **A lot's dated documents freeze when its last block merges**, not at writing and not at the first pull request that
  carries them. Until then a block's pull request may correct them, in the `(Corrected: ...)` form at the sentence it
  corrects, never a rewrite. After the freeze, changes go in a new dated document, cross-linked both ways, the old one
  marked `Status: Superseded by <file>`.
- **The backlog is the pressure valve**: findings the operator declined, or that genuinely belong to another lot, are
  proposed for it rather than done or lost. What the operator authorized is fixed in the lot instead.
- **A backlog item holds in two lines**, plus a pointer to the dated document that carries its reasoning. Symptom and
  where it lives, nothing else: the argument is usually already written in the spec or handoff of the lot that filed it,
  and copying it here stores it twice and makes the file unreadable at the length that costs.
- **An item whose reasoning lives nowhere else keeps it.** Dated documents are append-only, so a finding whose argument
  was only ever written into the backlog cannot be moved out of it now:
  compressing it would destroy it, not relocate it. The items in that state are the ones the file marks; do not put a
  count here, which would drift on the next edit. **This is an exception to inherit, not to create**: a new item is
  filed by a lot that has a spec and a handoff, so its reasoning goes there and the entry stays at two lines.
- **A dated document does not put a number on a living file**: it records what it did; the count is read where it lives.
  Say "the items this lot leaves open are 1, 2 and 14", never "the band holds three".

## Style

- **Everything in the repository is in English** (identifiers, comments, logs, commits, PRs, docs); conversation stays
  in the user's language; genuine domain data keeps its own language.
- **Write in plain language**: lead with the point, active voice, present tense, short sentences, common words; lists,
  tables and headings where they carry structure faster than prose. Applies to everything written for the repository and
  every message to the user.
- **A comment holds in two lines.** Past that it is documentation and goes where documentation lives (spec, ADR,
  backlog, handoff); the comment keeps the one sentence that says why plus the pointer.
- **Comments explain why, not what.** Density matches the surrounding file.
- **No abbreviations in code, comments, KDocs or logs**: domain terms are spelled out ("garbage collection", not "GC").
  Narrative documents may abbreviate after the first definition.
