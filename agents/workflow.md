# Workflow

How work moves through this repository: scope, evidence, design judgement, phases, reviews, integration. Engineering
norms are in `agents/engineering.md`; writing rules in
`agents/writing.md`.

## Scope

- **Stay inside the repository.** Never read, list or search `$HOME`, parent directories, or another repository; a git
  worktree is its own root.
- **An adjacent defect has three tiers**. No diff hunk should be unexplainable by the request or by the answer the
  operator gave.
    1. **Trivial, obviously correct and contained** : fixed in the change that finds it, flagged in the final message.
       This is the boy-scout rule.
    2. **Larger, and reachable inside this lot**: stop and ask the operator **at the moment of discovery**, stating the
       defect, the size of the fix and the block it would join. Not at the next boundary: the operator prefers being
       interrupted while the context is live over rebuilding it afterward. This tier is where the backlog drains.
    3. **Refused by the operator, or genuinely another lot's**: the backlog.
- **Asking is not optional and neither is stopping.** Tier 2 is a question, so the work waits for the answer. Fixing it
  unasked and backlogging it silently are both wrong.

## Evidence

Nothing is asserted without the command that established it, nothing changed without the diff.

- **A measurement an existing document carries is dated, not current**: re-run it before acting on it, and correct the
  document when the numbers differ.
- **A check that cannot fail is not a check.** Before offering a command as evidence, name the output that would have
  proved you wrong.
- **File content is written with the edit tool, never by a command** (redirection, heredoc, `tee`,
  `sed -i`). Exceptions: throwaway output, and commands whose declared product is the file (formatter, scaffolder,
  generator, compiler).
- **Refuted beats plausible.** Drop a hypothesis the user's evidence contradicts.
- **Consult the declared documentation source**, for any library, CLI or version-dependent value. The source resolves to
  current upstream docs: Quarkus, Ebean, libvips (vips-ffm), Gradle. Name the source when a claim rests on it.

## Design (how to decide)

Decisions already taken are under Design invariants in `agents/engineering.md`.

- **Prefer the convention the tool already has**; a new abstraction is justified in one line naming the convention found
  insufficient.
- **Fix the design, do not work around it.** Smells: the same explanatory comment repeated at several sites; a domain
  type widened to nullable; a workaround for a tool limitation nobody verified...
- **Name the root cause, not only the symptom**: a backlog entry born from a structural symptom names the design smell
  and the refactor that removes it. Fixing inline is still forbidden.
- **Refactor as a first-class solution**: propose it during Discuss/Design, the human arbitrates, the ADR records. Never
  refactor inline without being asked.
- **Never move or rename something to escape a constraint**: satisfy it or report a blocker.
- **A setting that should not exist is not fixed by a good default**: say it should not be there.

## Phases

A work session produces a `lot`, composed of autonomous `blocks`. Two agents share it
(`docs/adr/0023-act-in-a-teammate-per-block.md`): the **lead**, the main loop the operator talks to, which keeps the
lot's thread and writes no block of a tier Spec lot; and one **teammate** per block, a named background agent that
implements it and is stopped when its pull request merges.

**Each block is its own branch off `main`**.   
Branch before the first file is written.   
Committing is cheap: commit autonomously.

### Tiers

The tier is the operator's decision: state the recommended tier and its trigger, then wait. Recommend the higher when
both fit; if the higher trigger surfaces mid-task, stop and ask again.

| Tier   | Trigger                                                                    | What runs                                                                       | Reviews                                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Direct | One block: no design decision, no new dependency, no public-surface change | Act, Verify, Integrate and Wrap, written inline by the lead                     | None by default; the operator may still ask for one                     |
| Spec   | Anything else                                                              | Discuss, Spec, then Act, Verify and Integrate per block in a teammate, then Wrap | The specification review, and the holistic review on the last code block |

### What a block is

A block is the smallest change that can be merged to `main` on its own.

Three conditions:

- **Green alone.** `dagger call gate` passes at the block's tip. A block therefore never ends between a red test commit
  and the implementation that answers it.
- **Coherent alone.** Nothing it adds is unreachable: every new port method has a caller, every configuration key is
  read, every new state is produced somewhere. Where a surface's real consumer arrives in a later block, the spec says
  so and the pull request repeats it.
- **Readable alone.** The diff excluding dated documents stays under 600 lines. Past that the block splits, or the spec
  states in one line why it cannot.

### The phases

Discuss and Spec run once for the lot. Then **Act, Verify and Integrate run once per block, in series**: a block's pull
request is merged before the next block starts. Wrap closes the lot.

1. **Discuss** : Explore the project, read the backlog, and ask the user questions to align. No code, no files.
2. **Spec** : One document, `docs/specs/<ISO date>-<slug>.md` describing in detail the work to do, its block table
   included. Reviewed once by an adversarial subagent the lead dispatches on `agents/reviews/spec.md`, its findings
   closed, then by the user. It is delivered in the first block's pull request and freezes when the lot's last block
   merges (`agents/writing.md`). A lot whose subject is this process writes its ADR and no separate spec.
3. **Act.** One block, in a teammate the lead spawns from `main` once the previous pull request has merged; one
   teammate lives at a time. Its brief points at the block's row in the spec, the spec, `AGENTS.md`, the branch name
   and the report shape under Integrate, and restates nothing. Strict TDD as `agents/engineering.md` states it. An
   adjacent defect found here takes one of the three tiers under Scope, and **tier 2 stops the teammate**: it sends the
   question to `main`, which the operator reads, and ends its turn. The operator's answer reaches it through the lead,
   by name and verbatim; the lead never answers a tier-2 question itself. A blocker takes the same path, a denied
   permission included, which is never routed through the lead. The teammate speaks only when it stops: tier-2
   question, blocker, pull request ready.
4. **Verify, entirely on the local branch. No pull request exists yet.** The teammate runs the full gate. **On the last
   code block of the lot, it writes the handoff first**, from the bodies of the lot's merged pull requests
   (`gh pr view`) and its own block, then reports. The lead dispatches the holistic review
   (`agents/reviews/holistic.md`) over the whole lot, `git diff <lot base>..<that block's head>`, merged blocks
   included: it reads the handoff, its findings against the current block go back to its teammate, and the rest
   become the closing block, the lot's last, with its own pull request. Tier Direct skips it.
5. **Integrate.** The teammate pushes, opens the pull request as a draft, waits for continuous integration, marks it
   ready and sends the link to `main`. The pull request's body is the block's report, in five parts: evidence (gate,
   continuous integration, the diff against the budget), tier-1 fixes, tier-2 questions with their answers, pitfalls,
   departures from the block table. It is merged only after the human has reviewed it (rebase only, no local-merge
   exemption), approval never assumed. **A red run, or a change the human asks for, returns the block to Verify**: the
   lead forwards it by name, the teammate commits the fix, re-runs the gate and reports ready again. On the operator's
   "merged", the lead stops the teammate by name and never messages it again, brings the shared working tree back to
   `main` (`git switch main && git pull --ff-only && git branch -d <branch>`), and the next block starts from `main`.
6. **Wrap.** Once per lot. The first half is the closing block: (a) the holistic findings fixed, each named in the
   handoff with its exit, and the count of those against an already merged block stated, that number being what series
   costs in rework; (b) the backlog reconciled, an item closed by a block having been deleted in that block's own pull
   request; (c) the handoff in `docs/handoffs/<ISO date> - handoff - <context>.md`, written in the last code block from
   the lot's pull requests and corrected here: current state, what was built, pitfalls, what is not validated, next
   step. The second half runs after that pull request merges: (d) tag the lot, an annotated `lot/X.Y.Z-<slug>` on the
   closing merge, pushed; (e) report what was done and the friction points, and every tier-2 question asked with the
   answer it got. That report is the input to Improve.

   **A lot tag is a delivery checkpoint, not a release.** `release.yml` triggers on `v*` and publishes a signed image
   to the registry; the `lot/` prefix cannot match it. A release is its own decision and its own tag.

## The backlog

- **Open items only.** No shipped section: completed work is recorded by its handoff, git history and tag. An item a
  block closes is deleted in that block's PR; Wrap reconciles in the closing block's diff, and the result is re-checked
  on `main` after that merge.
- **A lot closes the backlog items adjacent to its subject.** Binding, not advisory
  (`docs/adr/0018-a-block-is-a-pull-request.md`, decision 6): the spec names every adjacent item, and for each one it
  leaves open it states why, which is the operator's to accept. A lot with no adjacent item says so. An adopted item
  that does not fit the block's budget becomes its own block; it is not thereby dropped.
- **An item holds in two lines**, plus a pointer to the dated document carrying its reasoning, with the one exception
  `agents/writing.md` states: an item whose reasoning lives nowhere else keeps it, and says so. An entry long enough to
  need scrolling is an entry nobody rereads. **There is no cap on how many items the backlog holds**: a cap discards
  findings to satisfy a number, and what grew here was the entries, not their count.
- **A review finding has four exits**: fixed inside the lot; a backlog item (work someone will do); an accepted limit
  (written where the decision lives, never copied to the backlog); or refused, with the reason in the handoff. Wrap
  states which exit each finding took. The default is the first: the backlog receives what the operator refused or what
  genuinely belongs to another lot, not what was merely out of the original scope.
- **Banded by nature before priority**, four bands: Open work (`P0`, `P1`, `P2`; a priority may hold nothing), Known
  limits (pointers to documents), Before beta (dated events), Features (the roadmap, unsequenced). A limit is not debt.
