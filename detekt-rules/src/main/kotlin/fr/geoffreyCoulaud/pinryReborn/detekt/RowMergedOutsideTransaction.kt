/**
 * A state transition is decided on the row as it is, inside the transaction that writes it.
 *
 * `Persistor.merge` writes every column and only `TaskModel` carries a version, so saving a row read
 * earlier restores that row's whole state, including whatever another actor committed in between. The
 * import row is written from two directions at once, a request and a worker, and this lot found nine
 * sites of that one defect before making the read and the write a single fenced pair.
 *
 * ## Reach
 *
 * The test is **inverted**, and this is the rule's whole shape: a save is reported unless its argument
 * is a construction. An insert is legal because a fresh row has no earlier state to restore; everything
 * else names a row that was read somewhere the transaction does not cover. Chasing the shapes that do
 * merge is what the first version tried, keying on a `copy` call written where the save is, and a named
 * local, a scoping function around the copy or one around the save all walked past it.
 *
 * A construction is told from a call by its name starting upper case, Kotlin's own convention, since
 * this rule set runs without type resolution. So does the rest: `save` and `inTransaction` are
 * spellings, not resolved members. The scope is set in `detekt.yml`, by path, over the import use
 * cases; the exports took the same fence by hand without this rule seeing them
 * (`docs/adr/0016-fence-by-compare-and-set.md`), and widening the filter is the open half of the
 * backlog item. **The message therefore names no helper**: there are two `saveFenced` now, one per
 * feature, and naming either would be wrong advice from the other.
 *
 * Two boundaries follow. A row built somewhere else and handed over through a property is reported all
 * the same (`imageRepository.save(created.image)` in `UserDataImportRunner`, suppressed inline with its
 * reason): the rule cannot see where that value came from, and the answer that keeps its reach is to
 * report and let the site say why.
 *
 * The second is the one to know. The rule sees where the write is, not where the read was, so a row
 * read outside and saved inside a transaction passes it: opening a transaction around a row taken
 * before it changes nothing about what the merge restores. That half is a behaviour, and it is held by
 * behaviour tests, whose transaction fake answers a read taken outside one with a cancelled row
 * (`UserDataImportRunnerTest`, `UserDataImportCancellerTest`). This rule is the other half: it fails
 * the build on a writer that never opened a transaction at all, which is the shape every one of the
 * nine sites took.
 *
 * None of them is left, so the rule holds no current violation open: every import-row write now goes
 * through `saveFenced` or `saveFencedOver`, and the completer's hand-over opens its own block. What it
 * guards is the next writer added to this package, which is why it stays after the fences landed.
