"""What the guard must allow, and what it must block. One table each.

The guard is a script and not an importable module, its name carrying a hyphen,
so every case runs it the way the harness does: a payload on stdin, the verdict
as the exit code. Nothing is mocked and nothing is written, which is what keeps
this file self-contained.

A case is a shell command, or a whole payload when the point is the payload
itself. The working directory is synthetic: the guard only compares path
prefixes and never touches the disk, so a real path would tie these expectations
to where the repository happens to be cloned (under /tmp, half of BLOCKED would
be disposable and the suite would go red for a reason that is not the guard).
