"""PreToolUse guard for the rules of AGENTS.md that prose cannot hold.

Two rules, applied by blocking the tool call before it runs:

- file content is written with the edit tool, never by a command, so that every
  change reaches the user as a reviewable diff
- a check that cannot fail is not a check

Writing is judged by its target, not by the command's name: a redirection is
allowed only into an explicitly disposable location. That allow-list is what
makes the guard survive `/add-dir`, worktrees and monorepos without knowing
anything about the layout of the working tree. Three checks judge by name
instead, because their target is not in the command: in-place editors, whose
script can write where the operand never says, patch application and scripts
read from stdin.

There is no shebang on purpose. The hook is invoked as `python3 <path>`, so a
copy that drops the executable bit cannot silently disable it.

Exit 0 allows the call. Exit 2 blocks it and returns the reason to the model,
which corrects itself without involving the user.
